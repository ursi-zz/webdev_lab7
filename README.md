wk 5 css assignment: styling an HTML table using CSS

Process:
    Use the index.html file, the css folder, and the images folder to create your lab repository. Include the css file found inside the folder.
    Use css to style the page and table. I don't want it to look like the default browser styling on anything. Use your own css heading, italics, and font weight.
    DO NOT use a css framework like bootstrap for your css.
    Add some appropriate headlines, titles, and any other content you think is appropriate to the document.
    Add html class and id hooks to make your css light and compact.
    Get data from here: https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/
    Use any 4 of the planets (not pluto or small bodies).
    Combine the data from any 4 planet pages into a single html page with one single table. I do not want separate tables/pages.
    Use any seven data fields: i.e., Mass, Diameter, Distance from sun, etc.
    Grading will be based on requirements and how well it is styled. Try to use images and various css properties to make your page look nice and unique.
    Goal is to show the data in a nice, readable and pleasant way in a combined table on a single page.
    Add at least 10 css style declarations.
    Apply CSS properties to the table via classes or ids on elements.
    Follow the video instructions for testing and turning in labs (How to Turn In Labs).
    Turn in the following:
        Repo Link
        Live Link
        Image of Validation Screen Capture
        THERE IS NO NEED FOR A FILE COMPARISON.

    This lab will be graded based on how your CSS style looks, and if you completed all the requested items.
        A very simply styled page in the top corner of the web page will not receive all the points.
        Try to make the page look fully styled and not like any browser default.
        Everybodyâ€™s page and tables should look unique.
